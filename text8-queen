eggs this will trigger a swarm where the old queen will take about half the worker bees to found a new colony leaving the new
queen with the other half of worker bees to continue the old colony the old queen begins to fail this is thought to be recognized
by a decrease in queen pheremones throughout the hive this situation is called supersedure at the end of the supersedure the old queen is generally
killed the old queen dies suddenly this is an emergency supersedure the worker bees will find several eggs or larvae in the right age range
and attempt to develop them into queens emergency supersedure can generally be recognized because the queen cell is built out from a regular cell of
feed them royal jelly this triggers an extended development as a pupa when the virgin queen emerges she is commonly thought to seek out other
queen cells and sting the infant queens within and that should two queens emerge simultaneously they will fight to the death recent studies however have
